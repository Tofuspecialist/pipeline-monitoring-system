# Smart Municipal Pipeline Monitoring System

Real-time leak detection and localization for District Metered Areas (DMA).

## 🚀 Prototype Features
- **Junction-Node Architecture**: Realistic city-block mapping of sensing points.
- **Dual-Sensor Analysis**: Visualizes pressure transients hitting two nodes with a Time-of-Arrival (TOA) delay.
- **Pinpoint Localization**: Calculates leak position based on fixed segment distances.

## 🛠️ Technology
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, Folium
- **Algorithm**: Time-of-Arrival (TOA) Localization
- **Data**: Emulated MPX5700AP pressure sensing streams (860Hz sampling equivalent).
